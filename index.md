This is really just an archive of any data science projects I have done or am currently working on. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. Let me test a link to a notebook. 
[Olist Brazil EDA and Market Channel Analysis](https://github.com/s1imreaper/datasci/blob/019930029e0016651032afbd8cdbefb7d28005ce/eda-and-rough-sentiment-analysis.ipynb)

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Manuel83/sample/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
